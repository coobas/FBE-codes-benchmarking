   Abstract = {A simple rigid plasma model is used to show that axisymmetric plasma instabilities (in two dimensions) will occur on a resistive time scale and do not depend on the plasma mass. This is the justification for ignoring the inertial term in two-dimensional studies of plasma shape control and vertical stability. In three dimensions, it is not normally possible to ignore the inertial terms when computing plasma instabilities. This results in a stiff system of equations (with multiple time scales) in which the driving terms causing plasma instabilities are small compared with the stable compressive terms. Techniques are described for implicit time integration and for representing the vector fields in a way to facilitate obtaining accurate solutions for plasma instabilities when a strong background magnetic field is present.},

   Abstract = {Free-boundary equilibrium codes are an essential tool for tokamak design studies and scenario development. In this contribution, the CEDRES++ code is presented and applications to ITER, JT-60SA and Tore Supra are reported on. A satisfactory benchmark of CEDRES++ with the DINA code was performed on an ITER Scenario 2 case at 32 different times across the discharge, both in direct and inverse mode. Ongoing design studies for the poloidal field coils system of JT-60SA, performed in the frame of the Broader Approach, were cross-checked with CEDRES++. Finally, a dimensioning study was carried out for the coils and power supplies for plasma vertical control in the frame of a feasibility study for the implementation of a divertor in Tore Supra.
